# I love this one
I really can't wait to get a replacement screen and resume work on this one.

It is currently incomplete. I really like the direction it is going but am unfinished on a few things.
- on the shelf about the moon photo for the phase of the moon display. It's cool... but too much?
- more space to fill in on the screen
- what else? audio, what's playing?

Unfortunately the screen or drive board just stopped working. It did a half clear and init and that was it.

I was going to have RPI4 run this and provide all services sitting in the base. I was struggling with the desire to also use the Pi as media player so I could utilize the cool speakers that are part of the Imac, but the audio amp I bought was garbage, and then the screen died.

When I resume work on this I may simplify and use an ESP32 to drive display. Perhaps also handle the audio differently and leave the Pi in the network cabinet on UPS power.
