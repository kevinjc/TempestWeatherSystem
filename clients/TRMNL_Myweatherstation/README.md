# TRMNL DIY kit from SEEED - The Current Project
This is the path for the medium display I will use going forward. This 7.5inch display is extremely fast, includes a battery pack, and no worries about a corrupt file system on power outage unintentional shutdown.

However... it is not ready. I am currently using the GFX libraries from Seeed for the display based on some samples and tutorials I found. I am not in love with them-- they were fast to implement and less "huh?" events than using the Waveshare libraries, but I feel like I have sacrificed too much. Maybe I just haven't read far enough, but :
- no image paste - so no pasting of icons. Will have to draw them with rays, circles, etc?
- the font is pixelated and blocky

But overall this platform is so much nicer, and so much faster.

Stay tuned
