# The Original Epaper Display
My first Epaper Display was a Waveshare 7.5 black-white from 2020. It was still running fine but unfortunately I broke it fitting it into a new case I printed.

This is still my favorite display. It is consistent, easy to ready and find the useful data. I would like to update icons and fix a few things.

However, I don't see using this in the future. I will be switching to the TRMNL DIY kit for the medium sized display like this. This kit from SEEED just has so much going for it.
